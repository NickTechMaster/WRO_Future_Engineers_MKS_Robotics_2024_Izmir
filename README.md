Introduction

We are Nico and Julian from Germany (Saarland), and this year we are once again participating as a team from Maximilian-Kolbe-Schule Wiebelskirchen in the WRO Future Engineers category. Last year, we successfully competed in the event, securing first place in the preliminary round in Waldkirch/Freiburg. This qualified us for the Germany Finals in Chemnitz, where we finished in 4th place. In addition, we have participated in many other competitions, including the "Robonight" in Saarbr√ºcken, where we placed second twice, and the "make-it" competition, where we took first place. However, it all started with the WRO, where we first competed in the "Mission" category in 2019.
