**Energy**  
Our car is powered by a standard 18V Bosch battery. This battery is inserted into a battery holder, from which a connection leads to the voltage converter. The converter steps the voltage down to 5V, which we need for the Raspberry Pis, the servo motor, and the ultrasonic sensors. Additionally, a motor controller is used, which is powered directly by 18V. It's important to note that the ultrasonic sensors run on 5V, while other sensors, like the color sensor, operate on 3.3V. The color sensor communicates with the Raspberry Pis via an I²C signal. I²C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) is a serial communication bus that connects devices using two lines.

**Sensors**  
A variety of sensors are installed in our car. First, we have integrated three HCSR-04 ultrasonic sensors, which are used to detect the road and calculate steering. The Raspberry Pi sends GPIO signals to the ultrasonic sensors, waits for the return of the ultrasonic signal, and measures the time between the outgoing and incoming signals to calculate the distance. GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) signals are digital input and output signals that can be generated or read by a microcontroller, like the Raspberry Pi, to control or communicate with external electronic components. Additionally, we have installed a color sensor that detects orange lines to count laps, allowing us to stop successfully after three laps. At the top, there is also a camera, a USB webcam from Logitech (Brio 500), which is used for obstacle detection. We selected this camera because of its wide-angle lens, exposure adjustment, and color rendering.
