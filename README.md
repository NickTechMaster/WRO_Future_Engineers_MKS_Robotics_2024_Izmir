<h3>Introduction</h3>

We are Nico and Julian from Saarland, Germany, and this year we’re proud to once again compete as a team from Maximilian-Kolbe-Schule Wiebelskirchen, a secondary school, in the WRO (World Robot Olympiad) Future Engineers category. Robotics and engineering have been a big part of our lives for several years now, and our interest in this field has grown through numerous school-based projects and competitions.
Our WRO journey began back in 2019 when we participated in the "Mission" category. Though we didn’t qualify for the Germany Finals in our first two attempts, these experiences motivated us to improve and eventually try a new challenge: the "Future Engineers" category. Since making that switch, we’ve reached the national finals multiple times, and this year we reached a major milestone by winning second place at the Germany Finals, which qualified us for the World Finals.
